(Q1.) Newton's Second Law

Algorithm:
----------
1. Create variable name resultant-force
2. Create variable named 'm' = 600
3. Create variable named 'a' = 2
4. Calculate resultant-force by multiplying m * a
5. Display the result

Pseudocode:
-----------
1. READ resultant-force
2. READ m=600
3. Read a=2
4. COMPUTE resultant-force = m*a
5. DISPLAY resultant force


(Q2.) Leap Year

Algorithm:
----------
1. List out years starting from 1582
2. Divide year / 4. If remainder = 0, go to step 3, else go to step 6
3. Divide year / 100. If remainder = 0 go to step 4, else go to step 5
4. Divide year / 400. If remainder = 0 go to step 5, else go to step 6
5. Print "This is a leap year (366 days)"
6. Print "This is a normal year (365 days)"


(Q3.) Laundry Day

Algorithm:
----------
1. Create variable counter
2. Set counter = 0
3. If counter is < 20, go to step 4, else go to step 5
4. Set counter = counter + 1, repeat step 3
5. Display "Washing Machine is on"


(Q4.)

Algorithm:
----------
1. Create variable student starting with 0 students
2. As long as students < 40, repeat step 3
3. Check each student & if student has long nails, show "punish the student", else show "praise the student"
